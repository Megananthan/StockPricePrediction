# StockPricePrediction
Aim
To find the most suitable model for the given dataset and to predict the closing rate for the given stock.

Conclusion:
As we can see from the two models, although the Linear Regression model seems to come close, 
it cannot be relied on as it's deviations from the actual values are erratic and un-predictable.

 Whereas when we see the LSTM model, we can see that it is accurate for the most part and is very 
 similar in shape to the actual graph,but is just a slight lower in magnitude and this can be rectified further.

 Therefore, we have concluded from our case study that the Linear Regression model 
 works, but the Neural Network is better for such time-sequence data.
